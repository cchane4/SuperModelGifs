# xmen_gifs

A GIPHY API-based GIF search app.

Allows you to search GIPHY for relevant GIFs by clicking on buttons with search terms. A list of starter topics (all x men super hero names) are available at the top of the page, but you can also feel free to add your own topics or search terms, preferably names of Supermodels. 

To view this application, you can visit http://********.com/. If you prefer, you can clone this repository and open `index.html` in a browser of your choosing.

Improvements: I would use a more cohesive color scheme and font-styles to make the page more presentable and consumable to the user.
